I'm currently attending a workshop on collaborative documentation.
We're learning about how to:

- setup a static website with Awestruct
- compose content in AsciiDoc
- collaborate on content using git and GitHub
- publish the website to GitHub Pages
- and lots more!
- had some beers
- and converted from MarkDown
- even more beers, please!!

In fact, this website was launched during the workshop.

I can't wait to show my site to these GitHub guys.
They'll be proud ;)
